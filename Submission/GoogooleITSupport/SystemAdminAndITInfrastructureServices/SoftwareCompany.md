### Software Company:

Network Funtime Company is a small company that builds open-source software. The company is made up software engineers, a few designers, one person in Human Resources (HR), and a small sales team. Altogether, there are 100 employees. They recently hired you as a system administrator to come in and become their IT department.

When a new person is hired on, the HR person purchases a laptop for them to do their work. The HR representative is unfamiliar with what type of hardware is out there; if a new employee requests a laptop, the HR person will purchase the cheapest option for a laptop online. Because of this, almost everyone has a different laptop model. The company doesn’t have too much revenue to spend, so they don’t order laptops until someone gets hired at the company. This leads to a few days of wait time from when someone starts to when they can actually work on a laptop.

The company doesn’t label their computers with anything, so if a computer is missing or stolen, there’s no way to audit it. There’s no inventory system to keep track of what’s currently in the fleet.

Once a computer is purchased, the HR person hands it to the new employee to set up. Software engineers that use Linux have to find a USB drive and add their preferred distribution to the laptop. Anytime someone needs something from HR -- whether it’s office related or tech related -- they email the HR representative directly.

When a new employee gets a machine, they’re given logins to use cloud services. They get a personal orientation with HR to make sure they can login. This requires the HR person to block off a few hours for every new employee. If an employee forgets the login to their machine, they have no way to retrieve a password and they have to reimage their machine. Employees don’t have a strict password requirement to set for their computers.

The company currently has many of their services in the cloud, such as email, word processors, spreadsheet applications, etc. They also use the application, Slack, for instant communication.

<p>
There are lots of problems descripted in this question document. 
  
Firstly, Let the employees to buy computer by themselves is not a good suggestion. They should draft a standard operating procedure (SOP) for procurement process. For a software company, computer have special requirement for then reason that developer will use it as a main weapon to product debugging and software running environment testing. It is essentially for the software company to implement a SOP for computer procurement. 
  
Secondly, the company should make remediation plans response to the affairs of, for example, facing a computer losing. Company’s computers should be well labelled and well documented. There should be a well-organized inventory system for all the company assets and it is useful in audit affairs.

Thirdly, IT support should help to draft a Standard for Computer OS Management. Building and maintaining optimized corporate computer OS Images. In a software company, developers need lots of professional development tools assistant the software developing process. A new employee may not familiar with those tools which are popularly used in the company. Problems happen when the need for cooperating to finish a task. So, standardize and streamline the process is helpful to save configuring time for setting up a new computer. On another aspect, there are lots of on-hand and well-designed schemes for OS configuring. It is valuable for an IT supporter to learn and overcome this challenge.

Fourthly, the company has not deployed a security Password Management Solution. Unfortunately, employees have to reimage their computer when they are having no way to retrieve their password. A Central Authentication solution can easy solve this problem. As helping employees with password issues is a common task for IT supporter. When an employee lost their password, IT support should help him reset their password to solve the problem.

Fifthly, the company has many of their services in the cloud. They should have a domain controller and central management services such as OpenLDAP, which can track computers connected to the domain. This could be used to provision software to any computers joined to the domain and would implement strict password management.
