<strong>Assignment:</strong> <p>For this writing project, you’ll be presented with three scenarios for different companies. You’ll be doing the systems administration for each company’s IT infrastructure. For each scenario, present improvements to processes based on the company’s needs and current restrictions. There’s no right or wrong answer to your consultation, but your responses should explain the problem, the improvement, and the rationale behind them. Please write a 200-400 word process review for each company presented to you.</p>

<ul>For each scenario:
<li>Explain the problem the company faces.</li>
<li>List at least five process improvements you plan to implement.</li>
<li>Explain the rationale behind each improvement recommendation.</li>
<ul>

<strong>Example Submissions</strong>
### Company X:
#### Process Improvement #1:
<ul>
<li>Problem: The organization doesn’t currently have disaster recovery or backups in place.</li>
<li>Solution: Implement an NAS solution to do daily differential backups and weekly full backups.</li>
<li>Reasoning: Company X is a small company. Since we have a restriction on financial resources, we should implement a cheaper solution for backups. We can get an affordable NAS and have backups done off-site.</li>
